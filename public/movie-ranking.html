<h1>Five Movies You Need to Watch</h1>
<h2>by Cole Purdy</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Suburbia</h3>
<p>Follow the lives of angsty, rebellious, apathetic and nihilistic Gen X young adults as a classmate of theirs from high school gomes through town during his massive rock band tour. </p>
<h3>He Died With a Falafel in His Hand</h3>
<p>A strange vignette film that follows a person through various living situations within his life.</p>
<h3>Empire Records</h3>
<p>The exact opposite of Suburbia. These kids are idealistic, hopeful and fun. But damn the man. Save the Empire.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</h3>
<p>The film that started in all. The Searchers in space.</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p>A weird man who hasn't done anything in his life finds himself infatuated when a weird woman comes to stay at his family's hotel. Impossible not love this movie.</p>
