<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cole Purdy. I'm originally from a small town in southern Illinois. I have always been fascinated by computers, programming and how all of this works. In fact, I even learned HTML as a small child as the result of my father randomly having some ancient book on it. That being said, I am now re-learning this at thirty-one years old as I aim to pivot my career towards front end web development. I regret not doing this sooner, but we are here now. Oh well.
